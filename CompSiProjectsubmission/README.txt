To run, the Program, the file: testfile.py simply needs to be run. 

After a certain time (depending if you decide to change the iteration number
or the timestep),you will be prompted with first the speed achieved by the
Jovian satellite, then the orbital periods of the planets.

Then the closest approach of the Martian and Jovian satellite with their
distance and time at which happened.

And finally the plot with the animation and the display of the total energy
of the system.

To change the strength of the satellite kick, you just need to go in the Classfile.py
and change manually the y velocity line 108 for the Martian and line 111 for the
Jovian satellite.

To remove or add a planet, simply add or remove the "#" sign at the beginning of a line in the datafile.txt
To add another planet simply enter its Mass, intial Position and velocity
